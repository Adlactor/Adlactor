> *Suffering? Yes, there is suffering. It must be so. And we must know of it, taste of it, build our houses upon its foundations. As life preys on life, so does human enterprise need vast inputs of suffering. It binds us together. The knowledge that there are others that cannot have what we have built affects us deeply. It is a cornerstone in our souls. That is something we discovered a very long time ago. It is vital. And it was this discovery that paved the way to Heaven's gate.* <br> - ***THE MAN from the_man_at_the_threshold.avi***

<br>Hiya! I go by **Proteus**, and I am currently attending the Malaysian campus of the **University of Nottingham**. <br>

## Intro: <br>
Surprisingly, I've started using GitHub actively this October; however, it's been a pretty seamless ride so far. And for those who are wondering, ***Project Leviathan*** is the designation assigned to this project which revolves around all the projects and academic, scientific and extracurricular notes that I have contributed and worked on over the course of my studies and beyond that.

[Notion Hub](https://mahmoudsallam.notion.site/) - This is where I store my academic, educational, and extracurricular notes. <br>

## Easter Egg: <br>
I try my best to actively reference greek mythology and general theological themes and stories whenever I can as I am deeply fascinated by them! :D
